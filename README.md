# handbooks
This is a public repo for keeping track of the sorts of things people put in lab handbooks. It comes from this twitter thread: https://twitter.com/samuelmehr/status/1139733291899080705?s=20. The file **topics.md** is a copy of the twitter thread.

I published an article about all this in *The Biologist*, which you can read at https://thebiologist.rsb.org.uk/biologist-features/158-biologist/features/2299-how-to-write-a-lab-handbook.

## lab manual template
Balazs Aczel and a group at https://improvingpsych.org/ put together a publicly available lab manual template at https://bit.ly/2FdVt8F. That Google Document also contains links to many other lab handbooks.

## list of links to publicly available handbooks
Below are some links I used to compile the original list. Please feel free to suggest other links to add to this document or submit docs to the repo (in the `example_handbooks` directory) by sending them to me (sam@wjh.harvard.edu) or by submitting a pull request.
